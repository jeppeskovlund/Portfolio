# Welcome to my Portfolio

Started studying IT-Technology the summer of 2022 at UCN, Aalborg Denmark. My experience with coding prior to that point was rather small. Since then my interest and commitment to learning more has only gone up.
  
For now I'll try to get as many of the programs I make up here to show what I can do and also my progress.
