# Welcome to my Portfolio

Started studying IT-Technology the summer of 2022 at UCN, Aalborg Denmark. My experience with coding prior to that point was rather small. Since then my interest and commitment to learning more has only gone up.
  
At school we use Python to code in and therefore most code here will be in Python, we also use a RPi for our projects and some of the code will include libs that is designed for that.
  
For now I'll try to get as many of the programs I make up here to show what I can do and also my progress.
