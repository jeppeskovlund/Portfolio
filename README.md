# Welcome to my Portfolio

Started studying IT-Technology the summer of 2022 at UCN, Aalborg Denmark. My experience with coding prior to that point was rather small. Since then my interest and commitment to learning more has only gone up.

At school we use Python to code in and therefore most code here will be in Python, we also use a RPi for our projects and some of the code will include libs that is designed for that.

For now I'll try to get as many of the programs I make up here to show what I can do and also my progress. Therefore I won't refactor my code for now even through I know atleast some of it could be better. Also sorry for the mix of Danish and English, going forward I'am working on being more consistent in both wording and formating.

## [Advent Of Code](https://github.com/jeppeskovlund/Portfolio/tree/main/AdventOfCode)

A yearly online coding advent calender with a new coding challenge each day of december. I haven't done all yet for 2022, but intend to try later this year once I have a broader understanding overall. [LINK](https://adventofcode.com/2022)

## [School Projects](https://github.com/jeppeskovlund/Portfolio/tree/main/School%20Projects)

At school our semesters are divided into different themes and projects. The code that I have worked on in each one is gathered here.

## Raspberry Pi

We made a PiHAT with various components at start of the school year to get us going. Playing around with it, connecting new components through the GPIO's to see how they work.  
Started making my breakboards recently to also understand how it all works together. RPi is awesome.

## Linux

I'm getting better each day with Linux, it is a great OS and i want to get even better around it. The last project made with my group I used both Linux on server and on the RPi each day, setting up connection between the 2 through SSH, setting up some crontabs and with crontab, ssh and rsync set up automatic data sync between those two.  
I'm familiar with most common commands, how the operators work, navigating my way around in the terminal, cron/crontab, ssh and rsync.

## Online Learning

Other than the code that is shown here I'm also learning and doing exercises on various sites these include:

- [Codewars (My profile)](https://www.codewars.com/users/Tykz42), small exersises with various problems.
- [TryHackMe (My profile)](https://tryhackme.com/p/jeppe.skovlund), learning more about security, hacking and protocols.
- [Exercism (My profile)](https://exercism.org/profiles/Tykz42), usually a bit bigger exercises with some documentation on topic that is being learned.
